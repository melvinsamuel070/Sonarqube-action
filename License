- The **`action.yml`** file defines your action and uses a composite action that runs the `entrypoint.sh` script.
- The **`entrypoint.sh`** file contains your SonarQube installation and configuration commands.
- The **`README.md`** provides users with examples on how to use the action in their workflows.

This setup will allow users to integrate the SonarQube installation action in their GitHub workflows seamlessly!
